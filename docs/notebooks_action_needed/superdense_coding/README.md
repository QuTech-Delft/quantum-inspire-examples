# Superdense Coding

In this notebook, we use the Starmon-5 backend in Quantum Inspire to implement the superdense coding algorithm.
With this quantum communication protocol, a sender (Bob) can transmit two classical bits of information to a
receiver (Alice) using only one qubit. In addition, this method of communication is highly secure against
eavesdropping since reading out the state during the communication will collapse the entangled state,
indicating the presence of a third party listening.
